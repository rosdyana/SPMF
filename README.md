# SPMF
**SPMF** is an **open-source data mining mining library** written in **Java**, specialized in **pattern mining** (the discovery of patterns in data) . 

It offers implementations of **156 data mining algorithms** for:

    - **association rule mining,**
    - **itemset mining,**
    - **sequential pattern**
    - **sequential rule mining,**
    - **sequence prediction,**
    - **periodic pattern mining,**
    - **episode mining**
    - **high-utility pattern mining,**
    - **time-series mining.**
    - **clustering and classification,**

The source code of each algorithm can be easily integrated in other Java software.

Moreover, SPMF can be used as a **standalone program** with a simple user interface or from the **command line.**

SPMF is fast and lightweight (no dependencies to other libraries).

The current version is **v2.35** and was released the **18th November 2018**.
